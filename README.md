Welcome to code-potluck!

When you learn something useful new code trick or concept, 
vet it out for a while. If it feels useful/robust/worth sharing,
bring it to code-potluck!

1. make a google slide deck introducing the topic. 

2. optional: make a file.py (with accompanying test_file.py) or
doctest embedded inside file.py. This is for praticing the concepts.

`pytest test_file.py` will run the test_file.py import file.py and 
report what is working and what is not working. Fix the defects
while contemplating the new code concepts. 

`python file.py` runs the tests embedded in the docstring when 
doc-string testing is used. 

It is also kind to provide a solution version in the solutions
folder.
